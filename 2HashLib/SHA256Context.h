	/*  When exporting a DLL on Windows/MSVC which containes a class that uses a vector as a member ( = STL structure),
	*      MSVC prompts with a warning saying that
	*      " class 'std::vector<unsigned char,std::allocator<_Ty>>' needs to have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'myClass' "
	*
	*  This is due to the fact that the size of the STL member (vector here) is not always the same (a vector can grow dynamically), leading to
	*      the size of the exported class not being always the same
	*  One way of fixing this is to declare a pointer to the STL structure, which guarantees a fixed size of the member (= pointer size = address size)
